# Hex To Binary Converter
This is a program (made in **C++** ofc) that converts hexadecimal to binary.
e.g. 7C00 in binary is 0111 1100 0000 0000.

Why C++? Because coding in C over and over is too boring for me, so I made it in C++, with similar but different features.

# What to use it for?
This is a personal project, I'm using it for my future OS-Dev projects (like an actual OS that I might upload here one day, or maybe it's already here, depending on when you are reading this).
But you can also use it too, whether it's for OS-Dev or just educational purposes.
This repo is archived and cannot be updated, if you found a problem, not my problem; you can live with it or change it and run g++ HTB.cpp -o Converter to update the .exe file.

A little warning: When opening the .exe program or for the first time, it might detect it as a virus. If you get that, simply ignore it, there is no code that will harm your PC, the code is open source, and you can even check it yourself.

Oh, and if you're wondering (I bet you're 100% not), I have not used any AI for this; everything in the code is made by me with some help from other people. So technically it is by me, but by the minds of others.
Do not enjoy this, enjoy your day :)
